        <p>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems,
            political systems, artifacts and technologies that originated in or are associated with the Indian
            subcontinent. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly
            connected to India by immigration, colonization, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast
            Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from place to place
            within the country.</p>

            Japan's indigenous culture originates primarily from the Yayoi people who settled in Japan between 1000 BCE
            and
            300 CE. Yayoi culture spread to the main island of Honshū, mixing with the native Jōmon culture.[2] Modern
            Japanese have an estimated 80% Yayoi and 20% Jōmon ancestry.[3]

            Japanese culture was influenced from ancient times to the Middle Ages primarily by multiple Chinese
            dynasties
            and to a lesser extent by other Asian countries. For example, one of the scripts for writing in the Japanese
            language is Chinese characters (kanji), but Japanese has no genetic relationship with Chinese.[4] Since the
            Meiji period Japan has been primarily influenced by western countries.

            The inhabitants of Japan experienced a long period of relative isolation from the outside world for over 220
            years during the Tokugawa shogunate until the arrival of the "Black Ships" and the Meiji period. Today, the
            culture of Japan stands as one of the most influential cultures around the world, mainly because of the
            global
            reach of its popular culture.[5][6] In 2020, U.S. News & World Report ranked Japan's cultural influence as
            the
            highest in Asia.[7]

        <p>Chinese culture (simplified Chinese: 中华文化; traditional Chinese: 中華文化; pinyin: Zhōnghuá wénhuà) is one of the
            world's oldest cultures, originating thousands of years ago.[1][2] The culture prevails across a large
            geographical region in East Asia and is extremely diverse and varying, with customs and traditions varying
            greatly between provinces, cities, and even towns as well. The terms 'China' and the geographical landmass
            of
            'China' has shifted across the centuries, with the last name being the Great Qing before the name 'China'
            became
            commonplace in modernity.

            Chinese civilization is historically considered a dominant culture of East Asia.[3] With China being one of
            the
            earliest ancient civilizations, Chinese culture exerts profound influence on the philosophy, virtue,
            etiquette,
            and traditions of Asia.[4] Chinese language, ceramics, architecture, music, dance, literature, martial arts,
            cuisine, visual arts, philosophy, business etiquette, religion, politics, and history have global influence,
            while its traditions and festivals are also celebrated, instilled, and practiced by people around the
            world.[5][6][7] </p>

        <h1>America</h1>
        <p>The European roots of the United States originate with the English settlers of colonial America during
            British rule. The varieties of English people, as opposed to the other peoples on the British Isles, were
            the overwhelming majority ethnic group in the 17th century (population of the colonies in 1700 was 250,000)
            and were 47.9% of percent of the total population of 3. 9 million. They constituted 60% of the whites at the
            first census in 1790 (%: 3.5 Welsh, 8.5 Scotch Irish, 4.3 Scots, 4.7 Irish, 7.2 German, 2.7 Dutch, 1.7
            French and 2 Swedish).[4] The English ethnic group contributed to the major cultural and social mindset and
            attitudes that evolved into the American character. Of the total population in each colony, they numbered
            from 30% in Pennsylvania to 85% in Massachusetts.[5] Large non-English immigrant populations from the 1720s
            to 1775, such as the Germans (100,000 or more), Scotch Irish (250,000), added enriched and modified the
            English cultural substrate.[6] The religious outlook was some versions of Protestantism (1.6% of the
            population were English, German and Irish Catholics).</p>
