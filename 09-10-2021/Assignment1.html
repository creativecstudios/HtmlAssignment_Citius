    <h1>Introduction To Java </h1>
    <h2>Java version history </h2>
    <p>
        The Java language has undergone several changes since JDK 1.0 as well as numerous additions of classes and packages to the standard library. Since J2SE 1.4, the evolution of the Java language has been governed by the Java Community Process (JCP), which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and 
specify additions and changes to the Java platform. The language is specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS).changes to the JLS are managed under JSR 901.In addition to the language changes, other changes have been made to the Java Class Library over the years, which has grown from a few hundred
 classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5. Entire new APIs, such as Swing and Java2D, have been introduced, and many of the original 
JDK 1.0 classes and methods have been deprecated. Some programs allow conversion of Java programs from one version of the Java platform to an older 
one (for example Java 5.0 backported to 1.4) (see Java backporting tools).

(Regarding Oracle Java SE Support Roadmap, version 17, 11 and 8 are the currently supported long-term support (LTS) versions)=Bold , where Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support. (Java 8 LTS last free software public update for commercial use was released by Oracle 
in January 2019)=Italic, while Oracle continues to release no-cost public Java 8 updates for development and personal use indefinitely.
Java 10 a previously supported rapid release version, had its support ended in September 2018 the same date support for Java 11 began.
 (Java 7 is no longer publicly supported. For Java 11, long-term support will not be provided by Oracle for the public; instead, the broader OpenJDK community,
 as Eclipse Adoption or others, is expected to perform the work.) = article
